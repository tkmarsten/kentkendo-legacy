          People with no prior kendo experience or have not yet reached armor,
          may register for the class at the beginning of each quarter.
          (Check calendar to see when quarter begins.)
          If attending, you will only need to wear comfortable exercise clothes - t-shirts and sweatpants.
          <br>

          If you are interested but would like to see what practice is like first, please come in and watch!

          If you have practiced kendo before and are new to the area, you may join
          practice at any time. But before you attend practice, please consult with the sensei and contact
          them so they are able to gain a better understanding of your previous experience and rank.
